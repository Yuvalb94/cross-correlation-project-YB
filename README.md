# Overview
This repository is a summary of my cross-correlation project as a part of my bachelors degree in Neuroscience. 
This was my first coding project, so the scripts are basic and they could appear slightly disorganized. I kept them as they were so i can go back and see my progress and what iv'e learned.

# The project


# The scripts
The repository includes the scripts that I used in every step of the way:
1. [cross_correlation]([
](https://github.com/Yuvalb94/cross-correlation-project-YB/blob/45601052a3a2eef9595f83c6959fb30782c70c9b/cross_correlation.py)) - I generated this script in the initial step in which I learned the process of cross-correlation, tried to calculate it from scratch based on given data of real neural activity (spike trains). This script takes the spike trains of two neurons, calculates the correlation between their activity over time and plots the resulted data in a PSTH - Post Stimulation Time Histogram - that shows the extent of the temporal relation between the activity of both neurons (see [example](https://github.com/Yuvalb94/cross-correlation-project-YB/blob/45601052a3a2eef9595f83c6959fb30782c70c9b/Figures/Cross_Correlation_Histogram_example.png)). The script is the final version I've reached and it also embeds principles from the second script. 
2. [plot_PSTH](https://github.com/Yuvalb94/cross-correlation-project-YB/blob/45601052a3a2eef9595f83c6959fb30782c70c9b/plot_PSTH.py) - This script was generated in the second step, where I attempted to plot the now known PSTH, together with statistical analysis based on a Generalized Linear Model. The green smoothed line shows the average, or expectd value, given the activity data of these two neurons, if they do not have an effect on each other (considered to be a neural connection). The magenta and cyan lines represent significant deviations from this 'expected' value, calculated only within a few milliseconds range from every recorded activity event(spike) of one neuron to the activity of the other. These deviations, if significant, are considered to imply that there is a connection between the neurons, a connection that will later be represente in the final product - the connectivity matrix.
3. [connectivity_matrix](https://github.com/Yuvalb94/cross-correlation-project-YB/blob/45601052a3a2eef9595f83c6959fb30782c70c9b/process_and_plot_W_2d.py). This script is the major script, the one i spent most of the time on. Its purpose is to take the cross-correlation calculations, together with the statistical analysis, to determine the connectivity between all possible pairs of neurons within the neuron population that we had data for (132 neurons). Then, present it in a informative way ([example](https://github.com/Yuvalb94/cross-correlation-project-YB/blob/45601052a3a2eef9595f83c6959fb30782c70c9b/Figures/connectivity_matrix_example.png)). The matrix show the connectivity in this neuron population, as neurons are aligned in the rows and the columns so that the intersection between each pair of neuron shows the if they are connected and to what extent. The magenta and cyan squares represent existing connections.
